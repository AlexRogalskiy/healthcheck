Package healthcheck helps you implement Kubernetes liveness and readiness checks
for your application. It supports synchronous checks, asynchronous (background)
checks, and edge-triggered checks.

It also includes a small library of generic checks for DNS, TCP, and HTTP
reachability as well as Goroutine usage.

Check status can be reported as a set of Prometheus metrics for easy
cluster-wide monitoring and alerting.
